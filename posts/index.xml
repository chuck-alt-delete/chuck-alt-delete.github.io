      <description>Every so often, I decide to turn my life upside down. A bit over a week ago, I made this announcement:
ðŸ“¢AnouncementðŸ“¢
Surprising even myself, I have decided to move on from @confluentinc and this will be my last week. Confluent is an amazing company, and in particular, @jwfbean , David Shook, and Maygol Kananizadeh have been such amazing teammates. 1/3

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m really excited to share that on Monday, December 6, I&amp;rsquo;ll be joining the technical marketing team at Confluent!
Goodbye, Curriculum Development I&amp;rsquo;ve had an amazing time learning and teaching data in motion as a curriculum developer in Confluent&amp;rsquo;s Education organization. I put a lot of energy into building curriculum development almost from the ground up, and it&amp;rsquo;s amazing to see the seeds I&amp;rsquo;ve planted grow into formidable saplings.
Reflecting on my time in curriculum development, here are a couple of things I&amp;rsquo;m proud of:</description>

      <title>Fun with Ansible&#39;s Docker Connection</title>

      <description>Introduction This lab is modified from one of my courses over at Confluent Education. The course is about using Confluentâ€™s Ansible playbooks, but I had so much fun setting up the lab environment that I thought others would too. This lab environment is cool because you can simulate your own Virtual Private Cloud locally using Ansibleâ€™s Docker connection.
The key to making this work is to use Jeff Geerlingâ€™s docker-&amp;lt;distro&amp;gt;-ansible Docker images and mounting the /sys/fs/cgroup into the container.</description>

      <description>Foreword from 2021 I wrote this post for Insight Data Science in 2019. I&amp;rsquo;ve updated it a tiny bit, but it&amp;rsquo;s mostly the same. It was published on Dzone and the Insight Data Science blog:
https://dzone.com/articles/how-to-prepare-for-your-devops-interview (40k views!) https://blog.insightdatascience.com/devops-interview-prep-guide-8cd3dc60e587 Introduction Motivation is a great start, but you&amp;rsquo;ll need the discipline to prepare effectively. I&amp;rsquo;ve written this guide to help you develop a disciplined interview preparation routine. Interviewing can really suckâ€Š-â€Šit&amp;rsquo;s random and can make you feel bad about yourself.</description>

      <description>This is the first post for Chuck+Alt+Delete! Welcome!
This site has two purposes:
&amp;ldquo;learn in public&amp;rdquo; through blog posts host my professional portfolio Learn in Public I was inspired by the #LearnInPublic hashtag on twitter. Learning in public makes one feel vulnerable, but the upsides in terms of community and learning can be tremendous. Even this post might evolve over time. This is a place for rough draft thinking.
Portfolio Hop over to my portfolio!</description>

      <description>Most of my work these last few years has lived in private repositories, so I&amp;rsquo;ve created this site to do more &amp;ldquo;learning in public.&amp;rdquo; I will keep this page updated with exemplars of my work.
